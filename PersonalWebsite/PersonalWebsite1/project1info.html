                    Developement on this website began in 2021 after an interview I had with a company recommended that I begin a personal project
                to improve my skills as a software developer. After searching a while for a good starter project I came across the concept of creating
                a personal website. I thought writing a website would help to improve my skills and since all of my experience at the time was in backend
                development it seemed logical to get experience in the frontend development field.

                    This page began with the very basics, finding out how to write html and were to even write the code. This process was fortunately
                easier than I thought it was going to be as html is fairly intuitive, and the recommended IDE for writing html was Visual Studio Code which
                is also easy to understand. Although I found html easy, building a website was difficult as I now had to make it visually appealing, leading
                me to discover the issue of a lack of ideas for a website.
