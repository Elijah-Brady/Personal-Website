                    Developement on this website began in 2021 after an interview I had with a company recommended that I begin a personal project
                to improve my skills as a software developer. After searching a while for a good starter project I came across the concept of creating
                a personal website. I thought writing a website would help to improve my skills and since all of my experience at the time was in backend
                development it seemed logical to get experience in the frontend development field.
