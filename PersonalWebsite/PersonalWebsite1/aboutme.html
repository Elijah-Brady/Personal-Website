            <h4 class="headers4">Programming Journey</h4>
            <p class="aboutme">
                    My very first encounter with programming was when I was probably about seven or eight years old. Me and my cousin, were
                very close and both shared a similar interest, video games. However, the interest didn't stop at just playing them, we
                designed them as well. There is a limit to what two seven year olds can do, so these "designs" were theory only. We would 
                often spend hours just coming up with ideas for various videogames that we thought would be very fun to play if they existed. 
                Things began to change from just theory into a possibility. At the time there was one such application that was free and allowed 
                for the creation of video games. My cousin unveiled this application which was called Game Maker, specifically Game Maker 7
                I believe but the exact name slips my memory. Using this usful software me and my cousin were able to code simple games using 
                building blocks in place of actual code. A little bit like Scratch, but more sophisticated. These games ranged from top-down 
                games like Space Invaders, to side-scrolling games like Mario. Naturally, these simple games, were not enough for our curiosity 
                as we soon discovered that Game Maker allowed for the writing of actual code in place of the given simple building blocks. 
                Unfortunately, there is only so much that two seven year olds can do without knowing were to begin, so our video game creating 
                stayed at the building block level.

            <p class="aboutme"> 
                    Even though I was stopped at seven from learning more, I was not stopped for good. When I was older probably about ten or eleven, 
                my parents had taken notice of my interests in programming and in the videogame, Minecraft. My parents then found a way to increase both 
                these interests with a service called Youth Digital. Essentially, what Youth Digital did was teach children how to do bits and pieces of 
                actual programming by teaching kids how to add modifications (or mods) to Minecraft. This was also my first encounter with Java and its object 
                oriented system, although there was little that I could understand since the code was fairly complex. After completing probably around five 
                basic mods, I once again tried to deviate from the course material and program something complex. Once again, I was ill prepared and 
                didn't get far before I was stopped by numerous errors, but my interest still remained.

            <p class="aboutme">
                    After my various childhood experience, my programming endeavors stopped, I had plans to continue with creating Minecraft mods, however 
                I faced an issue. My family switched profiles on the macbook that I had been using for making the mods and everything was corrupted and 
                stopped working. After this, time passed and suddenly I found that I was a senior in high school with only a rough idea of what degree I 
                wanted to pursue in college. I did have some clues, I found that I did not like physics, which led me to decide that the engineering route 
                was probably not the best for me since Iowa State has difficult physics classes. My next clue was that I remembered how much I had enjoyed 
                the small bits of programming when I was a lot younger. I then decided to do a bit of a gamble and go for a major in computer science with 
                virtually no knowledge of what the field would focus on, other than the major was based in programming. Now sitting at roughly two years in a 
                computer science major, I can tell that my gamble was worth it. Although difficult, I have found that I thoroughly enjoy the major and the 
                learning curves that come with it.

            <p class="aboutme">
                    For a large majority of my life I have practiced the martial art TaeKwonDo. From about the age of ten or eleven me, my father, and my two
                brothers began attending a martial arts school near my home town.

            <p class="aboutme">
                    Throughout my time in programming I have had my fair share of experiences in the field.
