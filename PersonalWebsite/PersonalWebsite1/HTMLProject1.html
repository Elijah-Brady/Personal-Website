                    Developement on this website began in 2021 after an interview I had with a company recommended that I begin a personal project
                to improve my skills as a software developer. After searching a while for a good starter project I came across the concept of creating
                a personal website. I thought writing a website would help to improve my skills and since all of my experience at the time was in backend
                development it seemed logical to get experience in the frontend development field.

                    This page began with the very basics, finding out how to write html and were to even write the code. This process was fortunately
                easier than I thought it was going to be as html is fairly intuitive, and the recommended IDE for writing html was Visual Studio Code which
                was also easy to understand. Although I found html easy, building a website was difficult as I now had to make it visually appealing, leading
                me to discover the issue of a lack of ideas for a website. This was not the only issue I ran into as I soon realized that in order to even 
                attempt to get to the point were I would have trouble coming up with ideas, I would have to learn CSS and Javascript basics. CSS was fairly easy
                to pick up on since there are a multitude of useful tutorials on the internet that provide good explanations of how to use it. The main issue 
                was with Javascript as it is fairly complex compared to html and CSS. Fortunately, I found a way that would allow me to learn how to use Javascript 
                while writing this website. The method was Bootstrap, which has been integral in the building of this website as it has allowed me to simplify 
                what I write for certain languages like Javascript. The language is not just simplified, I can also go and check how the various commands are written
                in the source language, allowing me to learn what does what.
